=============
_If you do play Project Euler, please do not look at code from problems you haven't solved yet. You'll be happier in the end._ This repo was mainly for me to start understand how to structure a repo.  <br> Most interesting problem I've done so far: 280.  My friend key: 300864_ed1d07d7066d4a21b3236f388020c38d
